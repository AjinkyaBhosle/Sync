# Platform Monetization & Fractional Music Rights System

> Revolutionary music rights tokenization and revenue model for the world's first decentralized AI music investment platform

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

This platform transforms traditional music creation into a **financial investment marketplace** where every song becomes a tradeable asset with 8 different types of fractional rights. The platform generates revenue through rights trading fees, subscriptions, and a comprehensive token economy, projecting growth from **$2.1M in Year 1 to $126M in Year 3**.

### **Key Innovation: Fractional Music Rights**
Every song has **multiple rights types**, each divisible into thousands of "slices" that can be independently bought, sold, and traded. This creates a **liquid market for music ownership** similar to stock trading, but for music.
